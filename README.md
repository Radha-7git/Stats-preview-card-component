# Stats Preview Card Component ‚ú®

A responsive and interactive Stats Preview Card built with **HTML**, **CSS** (Tailwind), and **JavaScript**. This project showcases a clean, modern card design featuring statistics with smooth animations using **GSAP**. It's ideal for use in dashboard-like applications or any project that needs a visually appealing statistics card. 

## Features üåü

- **Responsive Design**: The card adjusts itself based on screen sizes using Tailwind's utility classes. 
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for quick and efficient styling. 
- **GSAP Animations**: Smooth fade-in animations for text and elements. ‚ú®
- **Hover and Interactive Effects**: Subtle hover effects for a more dynamic user experience.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the card. 
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast and responsive styling, using utility-first classes. 
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: For smooth and performant animations.


## How It Works
The main card is designed using Tailwind CSS for a quick and responsive layout. Tailwind's utility classes make it easy to create a flexible layout that works across all screen sizes.

The background images change depending on the screen size, with mobile images being shown on smaller screens and desktop images on larger ones.

GSAP Animations are applied to the text elements (headers and paragraphs), making them fade in sequentially. This enhances the visual experience and adds smooth transitions when the card is loaded.

Custom Styling: Custom colors and backgrounds have been applied using Tailwind‚Äôs utility classes. You can adjust these styles by modifying the classes or extending them in your Tailwind config.
